\begin_layout Chapter
Getting and installing Salstat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Buying or downloading?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to use Salstat, you have a simple choice.
 You can either download it and install all the additional libraries (instructio
ns are below) or you can pay for a download with everything contained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it fair to have a paid-for version? Ever penny earned by Salstat goes
 back into Salstat's development.
 It will always be a volunteer project because it's unlikely that we will
 ever earn enough to work on Salstat alone.
 All of us have day-jobs.
 However, even a little money is useful to afford (for example) a new developmen
t machine or to pay bounties for bug hunting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of course, you don't have to pay anything.
 If you wish, you can download and use Salstat for nothing.
 It does take a bit of preparation which you will have to do yourself, but
 it's not impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
For all platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these libraries need to be installed.
 All of these are freely available at the time of writing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Python (this is the base language)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Setuptools (this helps install a lot of libraries)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
wxPython (this runs the GUI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Numpy (this handles a lot of numeric processing)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SciPy (this is a scientific library)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
requests (this fetches web pages)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Beautiful Soup (this parses HTML code)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
xlrd (this loads Excel worksheets)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
xlwt (this saves Excel worksheets)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ezodf (this saves and loads Libre Office Calc worksheets)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sas7bdat (this loads SAS files)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Python needs to be done first because everything else needs it.
 I'd suggest installing Setuptools next.

\begin_layout Chapter
Getting data into Salstat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Typing in by hand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Salstat starts, you'll see 2 parts of the program: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A data editor (with a grid, much like a spreadsheet)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data output (it will have a heading like, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Salstat Statistics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the top)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data editor works much like a spreadsheet except that it doesn't do
 calculations or any fancy stuff.
 Each box, or 
\shape italic
cell
\shape default
, contains one unit of data (a 
\shape italic
datum
\shape default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can enter data by just typing it in and pressing the enter of return
 keys.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you perform some analysis, the output is presented in the data output
 part of the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Comma-separated value (CSV) files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files are plain text files in which each item
 of data is separated (or 
\shape italic
delimited
\shape default
) by a particular value.
 This value is probably most commonly a comma but it might be a semi-colon,
 a space, or something else.
 Salstat can handle a variety of delimiters and even multiple ones at once.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To load a CSV file, either
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Press Control-O at the same time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to the menu, click on 'File' then click on 'Open...'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dialog will appear and you can navigate around to file the CSV file you
 want to analyse.
 Click on 'Ok' and a new dialog will appear just like [link].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[image of CSV preview dialog]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dialog helps you to preview the file before it's loaded.
 Only a few lines will be shown at this stage (this is useful if you have
 a truly enormous file because then your machine won't struggle to display
 the lot until you actually load it properly after ther preview!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What you can do here is to change the various settings until the file looks
 like it's going to load correctly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting delimiters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can select, for example, from a range of common delimiters or even enter
 your own.
 The comma is selected by default but you can change this if you wish or
 even have multiple delimiters in one go if you need to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Line endings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Files from different operating system u
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Headings and importing from line...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Excel and Libre Office Calc spreadsheets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat can handle Microsoft Excel and Libre Office calc spreadsheets.
 File extensions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Excel .xls .xlsx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
LibreOffice ods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Loading spreadsheets is much the same as loading CSV files with a few crucial
 differences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You won't select delimiters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will be asked to select which worksheet.
 Spreadsheets often have multiple worksheets and Salstat can only load data
 from one worksheet at any time.
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you've found the spreadsheet file, open it and you will be shown a
 preview [link]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[image of preview]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can see that each worksheet produces a tab at the top of the preview
 grid.
 Select which one has your data on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
HTML tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you load a file with the extension HTML, HTM or XML (upper or lower case),
 Salstat will treat it like a HTML file.
 What it does then is look for the <table> tag and load the table as data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because HTML tables can contain more than one table, a preview is again
 shown in which you can select which table has the data you want.
 If empty tables apear, then don't worry – tables are often (mis) used for
 layout rather than holding tabular data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SAS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SAS files (from version 8 onwards) are loaded straight in.
 Just find the file and open it as normal and the data should appear in
 the data editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
From live web pages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Find a web page with a table of data you want
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Copy the page's URL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to Salstat, press Control-U or the menu 'File' -> 'Scrape from URL'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Paste the URL into the dialog (Control-V).
 Click the 'Ok' button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A preview window shows all the tables it found with one in each tab
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select which table you want and click the 'Import' button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the best features of Salstat is the ability to grab data from web
 pages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this means is that if you see a web page with a table of data that
 you want to analyse, you can download it directly into Salstat without
 having to save it somewhere else first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Web pages can well contain multiple tables so a preview is shown of all
 the tables Salstat found in the web page.
 Here, you can select which table you want to load (if any!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're not recommending you do this when ever you can –
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

a lot of data might well be copyrighted.
 It's entirely your choice to judge whether you have permission to do this
 or not.

\begin_layout Chapter
Describing data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I'm faced with a mass of numbers, my favourite thing to do is to summarise
 it and describe it in different ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat is really good at this because it offers a large range of descriptive
 statistics that should be suitable for most purposes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic descriptives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Menu: 'Analyse' -> 'Describe data' (shows dialog)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the variable(s) you want to analyse in the top-left box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the tests you want in the right-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click the 'Analyse' button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results appear in the output window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic descriptives are produced when you want a reasonably simple summary
 of data.
 Things like finding out how many items there are (and how many are missing),
 the sum, the mean, the median, and measures of dispersion like the variance,
 standard deviation and standard error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat's interface draws a distinction between basic and advanced descriptive
 statistics.
 As you will see, you can choose to view either the fairly limited range
 of basic descriptives because they are what most people need most of the
 time; or you can view the full range and select what you need.
 We made this distinction because we have lots of tests (like 9 forms of
 quantile) so wanted to let our users only see a limited list to begin with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do basic descriptives, go to the menu and click on the 'Analyse' item
 and the 'Describe data' option.
 You will see a dialog like below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You now need to tell Salstat what to do (what test) and where to do it (what
 variable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
What to do
\shape default
: On the right-hand side, there is a tabbed window showing a list of basic
 descriptive tests.
 Click on the ones you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Where to do it
\shape default
: On the left-hand side at the top is a window with a list of column names
 for each variable.
 Select which ones you want to analyse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And once you've then clicked on the 'Analyse' button, the results will appear
 in the output screen like below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are in a table with the variables as rows and the statistic
 as columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced descriptives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Menu: 'Analyse' -> 'Describe data' (shows dialog)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the variable(s) you want to analyse in the top-left-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click on the tab marked 'advanced' on top of the right-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select from the longer list of tests in the right-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click the 'Analyse' button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results appear in the output window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat has a large range of descriptive statistics and it's a list that
 is likely to increase with time.
 To access the full range of tests, just open a dialog for descriptive statistic
s as above, but instead of selecting some descriptives, click on the tab
 marked, 'Advanced' and you'll see a much longer list of tests.
 You'll need to scroll through this list to see them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cross-tabulated descriptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Menu: 'Analyse' -> 'Describe data' (shows dialog)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the variable(s) you want to analyse in the top-left-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the independent (grouping) variable in the bottom-left-hand box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select the tests you want in the right-hand box (basic or advanced)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click the 'Analyse' button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results appear in the output window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat can also produce cross-tabulated statistics.
 This is where a variable is divided into groups by another variable.
 Table [XXX] shows an example:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This table shows a dependent variable with 6 items divided into 2 groups,
 the first indicated by an independent variable score of '
\shape italic
male
\shape default
' and the other by a score of '
\shape italic
female
\shape default
'.
 This means that all the scores 
\shape italic
34.6
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
34.2
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
34.9
\shape default
 were from female participants and the scores
\shape italic
24.6
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
21.7
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
28.3
\shape default
 were from males.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salstat can handle lots of grouping variables.
 They can be numbers (integers or floats) or strings if you want.
 And it can handle as many grouping variables as you like, as long as your
 computer can handle it.
